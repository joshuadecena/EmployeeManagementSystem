Capstone Project: Employee Management System 
Project Overview 
Develop an Employee Management System using Core Java (J2SE) with an emphasis on object-oriented 
programming principles such as abstrac on, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsula on. The system will 
include valida on and excep on handling for inputs, looping, use of collec on interfaces, and abstract classes. 
The project will also involve basic input, processing, saving results into a MySQL database, retrieving, and 
displaying data. Addi onally, it will include unit tes ng and a web interface using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and 
Spring Boot.

Implementa on Details 
1. Object-Oriented Programming Principles 
o Abstrac on: Create abstract classes for common func onali es. 
o Polymorphism: Use method overriding and interfaces. 
o Inheritance: Create a base class for common a ributes and methods. 
o Encapsula on: Use private fields and public ge er/se er methods. 
2. Valida on and Excep on Handling 
o Validate user inputs (e.g., non-empty fields, valid age range). 
o Handle excep ons (e.g., invalid input, database connec on errors). 
3. Collec on Interface 
o Use collec ons (e.g., ArrayList) to manage employee data. 
4. Abstract Class 
o Create an abstract class Person with common a ributes (e.g., name, date of birth).
